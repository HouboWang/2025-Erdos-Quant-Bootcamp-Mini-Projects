# Mini-Projects

In project 1 and 2, we construct two portfolios as we choose Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Ford, and GM as picked stocks. One portfolio is low-risk, which we primarily minimize the volatility. The other one is high-risk, which we aim at maximizing the return. Then, we apply the Shapiroâ€“Wilk test to test the normality assumption of each stock in 5 sub-periods of 252 days, and find some periods of each stock that violate the assumption. Deleting the outliers works perfectly. Eventually, we construct a portfolio that maintains the normality assumption to the greatest extent. 

In project 3, we graphically depict partial derivatives of call option C and put option P with respect to time to expiration and strike price. We interpret the graphs in detail, and relate graphs between call option and put option by the put-call parity. 

In project 4, following the ideas of how to delta hedge sold call options in class, we explore the impact of a non-constant volatility on the distribution of profit/loss. The result is not ideal, and it implies that more advanced techniques of sigma-hedging are desired.
